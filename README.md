# pyqt-gpt-gui-generator
PyQt GUI generator (only one widget) which is using GPT and QMdiArea to show result immediately

## Requirements
* PyQt5 >= 5.14
* openai

## How to Use
1. git clone ~
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python main.py
4. Register your openai key, write the prompt, press the button. The time that spent depends on what you wrote in the prompt. After processing is finished, result will be shown in the QMdiArea.

## Note
* You can find `result.py` to get the whole source generated by GPT.
* This is using json mode to only get the source itself, that's how this magic works.
* Only one widget at a time. You can make application out of this.
* In `script.py` file:
  * PROMPT - I made this sublime prompt thanks for Prompt Wizard GPTs.
  * GPTJsonWrapper - for managing json mode GPT response easily. This is used my other GPT related projects as well, which is really easy to use (for me, at least)

## Purpose
This is one idea popped in my head that generates GUI on instance by GPT. I make the PyQt version of it.
